### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a machine learning engineer focusing on computer vision for medical imaging data! I've worked on digital pathology and projects based on our robotic microscopes. 

I played a key role on the [GEDI-CNN](https://github.com/finkbeiner-lab/GEDI-ORDER) to predict whether a neuron is alive or dead. Our lab regularly uses the model and results are published [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf8142?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed). 

## Personal Projects
With Raspberry Pi and Tensorflow, I made a [robot that identifies and reacts to human facial expression](https://github.com/jdlamstein/happybot). 

In grad school, I made an [N-body simulation of the solar system](https://github.com/jdlamstein/N-body-Gravity-Simulator) in python with the leapfrog method.
